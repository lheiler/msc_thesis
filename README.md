# MSc Thesis: Evaluating Computational Brain Models as Dimensionality Reduction Methods for EEG
**Author:** Lorenz Heiler

**Institution:** Imperial College London

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete codebase and datasets for my Master's Thesis. 

## Repository Structure
* **/code**: Contains the core implementation, models, and scripts. 
    * *Note: See the [detailed README in the code directory](./code/README.md) for setup and execution instructions.*
* **/Datasets**: Data used for training and evaluation (managed via Git LFS).
* **/model_comparison_results_complete**: Final output logs and performance metrics.
* **/testing**: Scripts for unit tests and validation.

## Quick Start
To get started with the code, navigate to the code directory:
```bash
cd code
# Follow instructions in code/README.md
